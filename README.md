Simple python script to detect distance based outliers for two-dimensioned datasets, based on the definition in the paper LOF: Identifying Density-Based Local Outliers by Markus M. Breunig†, Hans-Peter Kriegel, Raymond T. Ng, Jörg Sander using two different distances: Euclidean and City Block (Comprehensive Survey on Distance/Similarity
Measures between Probability Density Functions by Sung-Hyuk Cha in INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL MODELS AND METHODS) using the Zahn dataset as en example.
